    <h2>Camelids</h2>
    <p>
        The four llamas and two camels are camelids Camelids tend to be large and
        are strictly herbivorous. Camelids differ from ruminants in several ways.
        They have a three-chambered rather than a four-chambered digestive tract;
        an upper lip that is split in two with each part separately mobile; and an
        isolated incisor in the upper jaw. They have long legs that, because they
        lack tensor skin to bridge between thigh and body, look longer still.
